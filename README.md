## Summary

This portfolio contains an About Me section detailing my personal background, a Projects section with links to some sample projects that I have worked on, a Contact form section to submit a contact request to me, and a Resume page that contains a link to download my resume.

This site was styled with the Bootstrap v5.3.2 Framework, with some manual tweaks and adjustments. The rest of the site was built using React.js for the structure, content, and routing.
